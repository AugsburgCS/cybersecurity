Password encryption is important for cybersecurity and it is relatable and relevant to all students. That  familiarity was leveraged to create two cybersecurity programming assignments – one in Python for CSC165 Introduction to Programming and one in Java for CSC341 Data Structures. As part of the lesson, students learn what is involved in securing passwords and their vulnerability to hacking, which opens up a discussion of professional and corporate responsibility with respect to information security. The assignment in both courses mimics a login process that has the user enter their username and password, then verifies those credentials by hashing the password and comparing it to the stored (hashed) password that is associated with that user. The “hashing” follows the spirit of encryption, but it is in no way usable for real password protection. However, the hashing process has educational value in the programming skills that students practice, in understanding number representation, and in gaining familiarity with the terms and process of password protection.

In both the Python and Java versions, students learn about representing numbers in decimal, binary, and hexadecimal, as well as ASCII and Unicode, by converting a user-entered password to different representations as it is being hashed. They learn about file I/O and managing and searching through data using linear search and dictionaries. They also practice basic programming skills. In the Java version for Data Structures (as an introduction to the topic), students use int[ ] arrays, as well as ArrayList, LinkedList, and HashMap, which are some of the data structures that students implement as part of the course. Also, the login process is done through a login window using Java graphics, therefore students learn a little bit about graphics and event-driven programming.
